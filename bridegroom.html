        <p><b>里かな恵</b></p>
        <p>I was born in Furano, Hokkaido and lived there until I was 18 before moving to Sapporo. I studied nursing and worked as a registered surgical nurse in Sapporo for different hospitals and clinics. </p>
        <p>Ramen is my favourite food; especially miso flavor!!! I enjoy reading shonen NOT shojo manga and love techno music. My favourite singer is Michael Jackson but also love Ulfuls (Tortoise Matsumoto) and Tokunaga Hideaki.</p>
        <p>I have always wanted to study English abroad and my fortune teller agreed that it was time. So in the winter of 2006, I traveled to Toronto to study English.</p>

        <p><b>趙健棠</b></p>
        <p>I was born and still live in Toronto, Ontario. I graduated from the U of Toronto Chemical Engineering program. I never followed through to become an engineer instead heading into computers and am now an I.T. Project Manager.</p>
        <p>Sushi is my favourite food: uni, kani miso and anago unagi. I love video games; favourites being Virtua Fighter with Demons’ Souls a close second and Final Fantasy Series third.</p>
        <p>I have been watching anime and reading manga since university (thanks ThomasJ). And also wanted to study Japanese but never found the time until much later in life. I am grateful for Csaba and John for invtting me to join them in early 2007.</p>
